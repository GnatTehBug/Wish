        <h1>The Two Factions: The Split Within the Temple</h1>
        <h2>The Literalists of the Hollow Deep</h2>
        <p>
          This group believes the 1800s writings are historical fact. To them,
          the cavern beneath the Mariana Trench was real, the early seekers
          truly lived there, and the collapse was a spiritual turning point.
          They see the Temple’s rituals as echoes of practices performed in that
          silent underground world.
        </p>
        <h2>The Metaphorists of the Tarnish</h2>
        <p>
          This group sees the Hollow Deep as a symbolic story. To them, the
          cavern represents the inner self, the pressure of the sea represents
          the weight of life, and the collapse symbolizes transformation. They
          believe the Temple’s power lies in interpretation, not archaeology.

          The Event That Triggered the Divide: The “Second Stone” Discovery
        </h1>
        <p>
          A Keeper named Lysa Venn claimed to have found a second polished stone
          identical to the Abyssal Reliquary. She said it washed ashore after a
          deep‑sea tremor — a sign, in her view, that the Hollow Deep had not
          fully collapsed. Literalists embraced this immediately. Metaphorists
          saw it as coincidence, or perhaps a crafted object mistaken for
          something ancient. Dr. Aswan Jens Jerrome did not comment publicly,
          which only deepened the divide.

        <h1>Two Internal Documents Showing the Schism</h1>
        <h2>Statement from the Literalists</h2>
        <p>
          “The early seekers did not speak in riddles. Their writings describe
          stone corridors, mineral light, and the great chamber where silence
          lived. These are not metaphors. The second stone is not an accident.
          It is a reminder that the Hollow Deep was real, and that its teachings
          were shaped by a place untouched by the world above. To deny the
          cavern is to deny the foundation of the Wish.”
        </p>
        <h2>Statement from the Metaphorists</h2>
        <p>
          “The Tarnished Temple is not a location. It is a condition of the
          spirit. The Hollow Deep is the quiet within us, the place where
          pressure becomes clarity. The polished stones are symbols, not relics.
          To cling to literal history is to miss the deeper alignment the Temple
          offers.”
