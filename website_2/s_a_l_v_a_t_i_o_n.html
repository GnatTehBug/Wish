    <h1>Rituals & Symbolic Practices of the Tarnished Temple</h1>
    <p>The Dawn Stillness</p>
    <p>
      Members gather just before sunrise, standing in a loose circle. No
      instructions are spoken. They simply breathe together until the first
      light touches the floor. This moment symbolizes the “first glint beneath
      the tarnish.”
    </p>
    <p>The Polishing Hour</p>
    <p>
      Once a week, followers spend an hour in quiet, repetitive tasks—wiping
      surfaces, sorting objects, or arranging items symmetrically. The act is
      symbolic rather than practical: a reminder that clarity often emerges
      through steady, mindful motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      During gatherings, each person places a small object—often something worn
      or insignificant—into a shared bowl. The object is not kept or examined.
      The act represents releasing a burden without needing to name it.
    </p>
    <p>The Alignment Meal</p>
    <p>
      Members eat in synchronized motions for the first few minutes of a shared
      meal. It’s not strict or enforced; it’s simply a way to feel the rhythm of
      the group before conversation begins.
