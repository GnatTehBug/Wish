      Dr. Aswan Jens Jerrome built his reputation on an uncanny ability to
      soothe even the most distressed patients, speaking with a calm certainty
      that made people feel as though he understood something deeper than
      medicine alone. Colleagues admired his devotion to routine—his dawn
      gatherings with staff, his insistence on shared reflection before major
      procedures, his quiet reminders that healing required not just skill, but
      alignment. No one questioned why his patients often left his care speaking
      of renewed purpose, or why they clung to his parting words as though they
      were more than simple encouragement. Outside the hospital, Jerrome hosted
      small community “wellness circles” that grew steadily in number, each
      meeting filled with people eager to hear his thoughts on unity, sacrifice,
      and the pursuit of a higher order of health. He never advertised them, yet
      attendance swelled, drawn by whispers of the doctor who could help people
      feel whole again. Those who stayed closest to him adopted his
      rituals—structured days, shared meals, and a reverence for the guiding
      principles he claimed had shaped his life. To most, he was simply a
      dedicated physician with an unusual philosophy. Only those who listened
      carefully noticed how his teachings hinted at something far more binding
      than self‑improvement.

      "The circles grow larger each week. I watch them enter—shoulders tight,
      eyes dulled—and I recognize the same dimming I once carried myself. They
      listen closely now. Some hear only the surface of my words, but a few… a
      few hear the undertone. They sense the shape beneath the language. I do
      not speak of temples or wishes directly. I do not need to. The rituals
      guide them more effectively than any declaration could. When they breathe
      together, when they fall into rhythm, I feel the room shift. Alignment is
      not a theory; it is a pulse. And when that pulse synchronizes, even
      briefly, the tarnish loosens. One day, perhaps, they will understand the
      full shape of the Temple. For now, the wish is enough."
