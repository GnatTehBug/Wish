        <h1>Welcome to the Wish of the Tarnished Temple</h1>
        <p>
          You arrive to us carrying your own measure of weight, your own
          dimming, your own unanswered questions. Here, none of that is a
          burden. Within the Temple, we honor the simple truth that every person
          begins their journey slightly worn by the world. The tarnish is not a
          flaw — it is the starting point. As you step into our gatherings, you
          join a community that moves with intention and listens with patience.
          We breathe together, reflect together, and learn to recognize the
          quiet shine that lives beneath the surface of every life. Whether you
          come seeking clarity, steadiness, or simply a place to pause, you are
          welcome to explore at your own pace. There are no demands placed upon
          you. Only an invitation: to notice the stillness, to feel the
          alignment, to let the wish within you rise. We are glad you’re here.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
        <p>
          The Wish of the Tarnished Temple welcomes all who feel worn by the
          world. We gather not to escape life, but to polish the parts of
          ourselves that have grown dim. Through shared reflection, structured
          calm, and intentional living, we seek to rediscover the clarity that
          resides beneath life’s noise. What We Practice Our circles emphasize
          routine, mindfulness, and communal support. We begin with quiet
          breathing, move into guided reflection, and close with a moment of
          collective intention. These practices are simple, steadying, and open
          to all. What We Offer A place to pause. A place to realign. A place to
          remember that even tarnished metal can shine again. If you feel called
          to explore deeper alignment, you are welcome to join us. No
          obligations. No expectations. Only the wish to become whole.
        </p>
        <h2>The Principles of Alignment</h2>
        <p>
          I. The Dimming Every person carries a quiet dulling—an accumulation of
          unspoken burdens. We do not reject this dimming; we study it. It is
          the first sign that the self is ready to be reshaped. II. The
          Polishing Alignment begins with repetition. Dawn rituals. Shared
          meals. Stillness before action. These rhythms smooth the roughness of
          the mind and prepare the spirit for clarity. III. The Binding
          Connection is not symbolic; it is essential. When individuals move in
          harmony, their intentions strengthen one another. What one cannot lift
          alone, many can raise effortlessly. IV. The Wish The Temple does not
          demand belief. It invites longing. The wish to rise above the tarnish
          is the only requirement. All else follows naturally.
